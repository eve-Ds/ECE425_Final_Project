 * @brief Source code for the UART_BLE driver.
 *
 * This file contains the function definitions for the UART_BLE driver.
 *
 * @note For more information regarding the UART module, refer to the
 * Universal Asynchronous Receivers / Transmitters (UARTs) section
 * of the TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller Datasheet.

 *
 * @note Assumes that the system clock (50 MHz) is used.
 *
 * The Adafruit BLE UART module uses the following pinout:
 *  - BLE UART MOD (Pin 1)  <-->  Tiva LaunchPad Pin PB7
 *  - BLE UART CTS (Pin 2)  <-->  Tiva LaunchPad Pin GND
 *  - BLE UART TXO (Pin 3)  <-->  Tiva LaunchPad Pin PB0 (U1RX)
 *  - BLE UART RXI (Pin 4)  <-->  Tiva LaunchPad Pin PB1 (U1TX)
 *  - BLE UART VIN (Pin 5)  <-->  Tiva LaunchPad VCC (3.3V)
 *  - BLE UART RTS (Pin 6)  <-->  Not Connected
 *  - BLE UART GND (Pin 7)  <-->  Tiva LaunchPad GND
 *  - BLE UART DFU (Pin 8)  <-->  Not Connected
